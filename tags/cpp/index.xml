      <description>After getting back into hands-on programming with C++ after a long break, I reached for the shiny new way of doing aggregate initialization, called designated initializers. In two short weeks of writing code, I managed to shoot myself in the foot due to incorrect assumptions about the ways that initialization work.
I reviewed some of the details of initialization, and developed some guidelines which should hopefully help prevent some footguns in the future.</description>

Quick color encoding fix 2023-12-30
Commit: 883ed07
The renderer contains two issues with color encoding. The model textures typically have a non-linear gamma ramp, and need to be converted to linear values. Non-linear RGB values cannot be mutually added or multiplied, so the color calculations have technically speaking not been correct.</description>
