      <description>After getting back into hands-on programming with C++ after a long break, I reached for the shiny new way of doing aggregate initialization, called designated initializers. In two short weeks of writing code, I managed to shoot myself in the foot due to incorrect assumptions about the ways that initialization work.
I reviewed some of the details of initialization, and developed some guidelines which should hopefully help prevent some footguns in the future.</description>

Avoiding triangle self-intersection 2023-12-17
Commit: 9183d42
It&amp;rsquo;s possible for the intersection point to be below the triangle if one isn&amp;rsquo;t careful, resulting in the next ray self-intersecting the triangle. The method from A Fast and Robust Method for Avoiding Self-Intersection, Ray Tracing Gems is implemented. It contains two parts.</description>
