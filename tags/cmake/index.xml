      <description>Not having to deal with loading data from a bunch of small files makes it easier to work with your executable. You can forget about the working directory, just run your app or tests or benchmarks! Alternatively, if you need to ship a library which needs to access stored data, this is also one way of distributing the data with the library.
This post contains notes about embedding arbitrary data, such as images or compiled shaders, into a C or C++ program at build time.</description>
