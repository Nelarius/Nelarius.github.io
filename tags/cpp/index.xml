      <description>After getting back into hands-on programming with C++ after a long break, I reached for the shiny new way of doing aggregate initialization, called designated initializers. In two short weeks of writing code, I managed to shoot myself in the foot due to incorrect assumptions about the ways that initialization work.
I reviewed some of the details of initialization, and developed some guidelines which should hopefully help prevent some footguns in the future.</description>

Implementing tiled texture support 2023-12-24
Commit: e190c51
In the Simple texture support section, an apparent texture issue with the Sponza atrium scene was highlighted. On further investigation, the 3d model&amp;rsquo;s texture coordinates were not contained in the [0, 1] range, which is what my texture sampler assumes. To look correct, the model assumes tiled texture coordinate support in the renderer.</description>
