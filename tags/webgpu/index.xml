      <description>This post is a devlog for my rayfinder project. Follow along to see the progress, starting from scratch by opening a simple window.
Raytracing in a compute pipeline 2024-06-21
Commit: d06c8c9
Raytracing is moved from the fragment shader to a compute shader. The compute shader outputs the color into a storage buffer. A new render pass, the resolve pass, is introduced. It renders a fullscreen quad, and outputs the color from the storage buffer as the fragment color.</description>

      <description>The first part of &amp;ldquo;Weekend raytracing with wgpu&amp;rdquo; left us with a basic implementation of Peter Shirley&amp;rsquo;s first book in the series of &amp;ldquo;Ray Tracing In One Weekend &amp;quot; books. &amp;ldquo;Ray Tracing: The Next Week&amp;rdquo; introduces additional features, such as texture support.
This post takes a look at adding a physically based sky model, in addition to adding textured material support. These features, combined, result in much nicer images than the basic renderer, without appreciably slowing down the renderer.</description>

      <description>Peter Shirley&amp;rsquo;s book Raytracing In One Weekend is a great way to kickstart your own path tracer. The book gives just enough information to get spheres rendered to your screen, minimizing the amount of time spent studying theory.
I wrote a straightforward implementation of the bookâ€™s renderer using Rust many years ago. Recently, I decided to go the extra mile and port the code to the GPU, using the wgpu crate.</description>
