      <description>After getting back into hands-on programming with C++ after a long break, I reached for the shiny new way of doing aggregate initialization, called designated initializers. In two short weeks of writing code, I managed to shoot myself in the foot due to incorrect assumptions about the ways that initialization work.
I reviewed some of the details of initialization, and developed some guidelines which should hopefully help prevent some footguns in the future.</description>

Implementing tiled texture support 2023-12-24
Commit: e190c51
In the Simple texture support section, an apparent texture issue with the Sponza atrium scene was highlighted. On further investigation, the 3d model&amp;rsquo;s texture coordinates were not contained in the [0, 1] range, which is what my texture sampler assumes. To look correct, the model assumes tiled texture coordinate support in the renderer.</description>

      <description>The first part of &amp;ldquo;Weekend raytracing with wgpu&amp;rdquo; left us with a basic implementation of Peter Shirley&amp;rsquo;s first book in the series of &amp;ldquo;Ray Tracing In One Weekend &amp;quot; books. &amp;ldquo;Ray Tracing: The Next Week&amp;rdquo; introduces additional features, such as texture support.
This post takes a look at adding a physically based sky model, in addition to adding textured material support. These features, combined, result in much nicer images than the basic renderer, without appreciably slowing down the renderer.</description>

      <description>Peter Shirley&amp;rsquo;s book Raytracing In One Weekend is a great way to kickstart your own path tracer. The book gives just enough information to get spheres rendered to your screen, minimizing the amount of time spent studying theory.
I wrote a straightforward implementation of the bookâ€™s renderer using Rust many years ago. Recently, I decided to go the extra mile and port the code to the GPU, using the wgpu crate.</description>

      <title>Writing a small ray tracer in Rust and Zig</title>

      <description>I spend most of my programming time writing C++. And like many other C++ programmers, I&amp;rsquo;ve shot myself in the foot countless times with a feature I didn&amp;rsquo;t fully grok. And I&amp;rsquo;ve spent enormous amounts of time trying to understand the language. Like many other C++ developers in this position, I find myself frequently daydreaming about switching to another more modern and easily understood language.
The two languages that I spent most of my time daydreaming about writing code in are Rust and Zig.</description>
