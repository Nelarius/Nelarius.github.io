      <description>You can read part 1 here.
Writing you own Wren bindings gives you full control over how your code interfaces with Wren. However, manually implementing the binding code for a large C++-Wren interface can be somewhat time consuming, especially when changes are made to the interface over time. Wren++ is a small C++ library that aims to automate most code binding tasks with a minimal runtime overhead. Like Wren itself, Wren++ aims to be simple and minimalistic to use.</description>

      <description>Wren is a small, fast, class-based scripting language designed to be easily embeddable in a host application. As such, it fills very much the same niche as Lua. Why would you choose Wren over Lua in your application? It boils mostly down to stylistic preferences. Wren is very class oriented, and adheres to the curly-brace style tradition, in contrast to Lua&amp;rsquo;s begin...end blocks. If one of the first things you always did in your Lua projects was design a class model, then Wren might be worth checking out.</description>
