      <description>Introduction Dithering is a fascinating and seemingly counter-intuitive technique. In order to demonstrate the technique, take a look at the following image. How many different shades of gray do you see in the picture?
How many did you guess? The answer is 2. Taking a closer look, we begin to see the pixels.
The original image is quantized to just two colors, fully black and white. How can an image with just black and white pixels look so good?</description>

      <description>I spend most of my programming time writing C++. And like many other C++ programmers, I&amp;rsquo;ve shot myself in the foot countless times with a feature I didn&amp;rsquo;t fully grok. And I&amp;rsquo;ve spent enormous amounts of time trying to understand the language. Like many other C++ developers in this position, I find myself frequently daydreaming about switching to another more modern and easily understood language.
The two languages that I spent most of my time daydreaming about writing code in are Rust and Zig.</description>
