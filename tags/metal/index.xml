      <description>To develop my main ray tracing renderer project, I have been working on a Macbook Air with an M2 chip. The renderer&amp;rsquo;s performance on the laptop has not been great, with frame rates in the decimals at fullscreen resolutions.
The M3 chip was introduced fairly recently (half a year ago at the time of writing) with support for ray tracing in the hardware. Anectodally, I have seen reports of 100 % improvements in performance.</description>
