      <description>Books, articles, and blog posts present the wavefront renderer architecture as a way to improve ray tracing performance on GPUs. In practice, it&amp;rsquo;s difficult to find information on whether I should expect performance improvements for my monolithic kernel hobby renderer on Apple&amp;rsquo;s M1, M2, or M3 chipsâ€”the latter having hardware-accelerated ray tracing. On Apple hardware, would switching to a wavefront architecture be a silver bullet yielding better performance?
There&amp;rsquo;s only one way to find out: write both a monolithic and a wavefront ray tracer with identical features and measure their performance across different devices.</description>

      <description>To develop my main ray tracing renderer project, I have been working on a Macbook Air with an M2 chip. The renderer&amp;rsquo;s performance on the laptop has not been great, with frame rates in the decimals at fullscreen resolutions.
The M3 chip was introduced fairly recently (half a year ago at the time of writing) with support for ray tracing in the hardware. Anectodally, I have seen reports of 100 % improvements in performance.</description>
