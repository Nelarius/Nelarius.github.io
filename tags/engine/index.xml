      <description>Fed up with entering numbers manually via the UI for each game object transform in my home-made game engine, I wanted to integrate a gizmo tool. Gizmos, at least in the context of game engine editors, are little 3d tools that you can use to manipulate objects in 3d space. While there are a few easy-ish-to-integrate transform gizmo libraries on github, I was not completely happy with them. The interface of tinygizmo is nice, but it intersects camera rays with the triangle meshes of the primitive.</description>
